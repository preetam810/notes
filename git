Git:

- Git stores data more like a stream of snapshots. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project, 
Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
- Other VCS store delta.

Config:
git config --global user.name "Preetam Bankhele"
git config --global user.email "preetam810@gmail.com"
git config --list


Setting are stored in .gitconfig in home directory


Basic Git Commands:
- clone, status, add, commit, init, push, pull, checkout, branch, log, diff, merge, remote

git clone https://github.com/preetam810/gittest.git
 
git status
o/p:
On branch master  << shows the current branch
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'. << shows branch is up to date with master and created a remote repository reference called "origin"

nothing to commit, working tree clean 


git add <file> : adds a file from working/untracked area to staging/tracked area

git commit -m "Modified Read me"
git commit -am "Modified Read me" << add and commit together

git commit --amend

git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit. << One commited change needs to be pushed to remote repo
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean << nothing to commit from staging area to local repo


git push origin master

git branch: shows the current branch


git init: initializes the current directory as new git working repository. Creates a .git folder

git ls-files : gives list of all files git is tracking in current dir.

git checkout <file> : discard changes done in working directory and restore to the last commited file

git reset HEAD <file> : to unstage file

git pull : Will pull down from a remote

git add -A
